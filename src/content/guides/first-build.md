# Introduction

Building your own PC is a rewarding experience. Not only do you get to customize every aspect of your machine, but you also save money compared to buying pre-built systems.

## Step 1: Choosing Your Parts

The most critical part of building a PC is ensuring all your components are compatible.

- **CPU**: The brain of your computer.
- **Motherboard**: Connects everything together.
- **RAM**: Short-term memory for active tasks.
- **GPU**: Handles graphics and gaming performance.

## Step 2: CPU Installation

1. Lift the retention arm on the motherboard socket.
2. Align the triangle on the CPU with the triangle on the socket.
3. Gently place the CPU into the socket. **Do not force it!**
4. Lower the retention arm to lock it in place.

## Step 3: Installing Memory (RAM)

Push the RAM sticks into the slots until you hear a satisfying _click_. Check your motherboard manual to know which slots to use (usually 2nd and 4th).

## Step 4: The Build

Now, place the motherboard into the case and secure it with screws. Then, install the GPU and PSU. Connect all the cables, and you're ready to boot!
